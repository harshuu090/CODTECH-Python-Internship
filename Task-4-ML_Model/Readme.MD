# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Internship Task - 4  
**Company:** CODTECH  
**Domain:** Machine Learning  

---

## 📝 Project Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning model to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Scikit-learn.

The model is trained on a labeled SMS dataset and evaluated using multiple performance metrics.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains:
- Text messages
- Corresponding labels (Spam = 1, Ham = 0)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models Used

1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression

Text data was converted into numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix

### 🔥 Accuracy Achieved:
- Naive Bayes: ~97-98%
- Logistic Regression: ~98-99%

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells in `spam_detection.ipynb`
